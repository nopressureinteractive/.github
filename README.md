# No Pressure Interactive — Archive

> **Status: Archived**

This repository (and the wider GitHub organization) is now archived.

As of **January 2026**, development, source of truth, and active collaboration for all No Pressure Interactive (NPI) projects have been migrated to a **self-hosted Gitea instance** running on our own infrastructure.

This decision reflects our long-term principles:

* **Local-first by default**
* **European data sovereignty**
* **Full control over code, access, and storage**
* **No vendor lock-in**
* **Auditability and privacy as core values**

---

## What this means

* **No new code will be pushed to GitHub.**
* Existing repositories are deleted**
* Issues, pull requests, and discussions on GitHub are **closed.**
* The canonical source of truth now lives on our private Gitea server.

---

## Why we moved

GitHub remains an excellent platform, but for our needs we prioritize:

* Self-hosted infrastructure
* Deterministic control over permissions and data
* Long-term independence from centralized providers
* Tight integration with our NAS, CI, and local AI tooling

This aligns with how we build software: offline-capable, resilient, and infrastructure-aware.
